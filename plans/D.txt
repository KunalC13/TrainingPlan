Based on the provided guidelines and user profile, I will create a 4-week workout plan tailored to D's needs. Please note that this plan may need adjustments based on actual progress, injuries, or other factors.

**User Profile Adjustments:**

* Since D has wrist injury, we'll modify exercises that involve heavy weights or stress on the wrists.
* For Core and Back exercises, we'll focus on lower-intensity exercises to avoid exacerbating any existing issues.
* Due to daily activity level of Home Office (e.g., remote work or studying from home), we won't include cardio exercises in this plan.

* Increase the weight or reps as you get stronger, but prioritize proper form and technique over heavier weights.
* Listen to your body and adjust the plan if you experience any discomfort or pain.

This workout plan will help D build a solid foundation for muscle strength, endurance, and overall fitness. However, please consult with a healthcare professional or certified personal trainer before starting any new exercise program.
