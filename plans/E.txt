**Additional Considerations:**

* Due to the user's knee injury, reduce weight and intensity as needed.
* Increase rest periods if needed, but prioritize progressive overload.
* Incorporate supersets or circuits on non-strength focused days (e.g., upper body day).
* Adjust the program based on individual progress and feedback.

**Progressive Overload:**

* Increase weight by 2.5-5kg every two weeks, or as soon as the user feels they can handle more.
* Aim to increase the intensity by 1-2% each week.
