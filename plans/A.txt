Based on the provided guidelines and user profile, I'll create a 4-week workout plan tailored to their needs. Please note that this is just an example, and it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional or certified personal trainer before starting any new exercise program.

**Day 6 and 7: Rest Days**

**Progression Details for Weeks 2-4:**

* Increase the weight used in exercises by 5% every week.
* Decrease the number of sets or reps as needed to avoid plateaus.

**Weak Points and Adjustments:**

* Knee Pain:
	+ Consider reducing the intensity or volume of squats and lunges to alleviate knee pain. This may mean decreasing the weight, rest time, or even switching to alternative exercises like leg press.
	+ Incorporate exercises that strengthen the quadriceps and hip muscles, such as leg extensions and hip abductions.
* Muscle Imbalances:
	+ Regularly check for muscle imbalances by assessing strength differences between legs, arms, and glutes. Addressing these discrepancies through targeted exercises will ensure overall fitness balance.

**Supersets or Circuits:**

To optimize time efficiency, incorporate supersets or circuits when possible:

Week 1:

* Circuit 1:
	+ Barbell Back Squat (4x8)
	+ Romanian Deadlift (3x10)
	+ Plank Hold (3x45 seconds)
* Circuit 2:
	+ Bench Press (4x10)
	+ Incline Dumbbell Press (3x12)
	+ Russian Twists (3x12)

Weeks 2-4:

* Continue incorporating supersets or circuits, but adjust the exercises and rep ranges based on individual progress.

**Rep-Max Table:**

Use this table to estimate your max performance for different reps and weights. For example, if you're doing 4 sets of 8 barbell back squats at 65% 1RM (50 kg), look up the corresponding rep max in the table to ensure you're targeting the right intensity.

Please note that this is a general workout plan, and it's essential to listen to your body and adjust as needed. Consult with a healthcare professional or certified personal trainer for personalized guidance.
