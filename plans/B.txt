**Adjustments**

* Since the user has knee pain, we will avoid any exercises that may exacerbate this issue. We will replace Side Lunges with Calf Raises in Week 2 and Week 4.
* To address weak points, we will increase the intensity of exercises such as Deadlift and Pull-Ups by reducing the weight.

**Progressive Overload**

* Increase the weight by 2.5-5kg every two weeks, or as soon as the user can perform the given number of reps with good form.
* Increase the number of reps by 2-3 every two weeks, or as soon as the user can complete the given number of reps with ease.

Note: This is a sample workout plan and may need to be adjusted based on individual needs and progress. It's always best to consult with a qualified fitness professional or doctor before starting any new exercise program.
