Bob,Lose Weight,Intermediate,5,Full Body,"Based on the provided information, I'll create a personalized training plan for Bob, an intermediate fitness level goalsetter with a focus on full body workouts.

**Training Goals:**

* Lose weight (Bob's primary goal)
* Improve overall fitness and health
* Increase strength and muscle mass

**Workout Frequency:**
Since Bob has 5 preferred workout days per week, we'll allocate 4-5 training sessions to accommodate his schedule.

2. Barbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 8-12 reps
3. Incline Dumbbell Press: 3 sets of 10-15 reps

2. Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 12-15 reps
3. Tricep Extensions (using a bench or chair): 3 sets of 12-15 reps
4. Plank: 3 sets, holding for 30-60 seconds
5. Russian twists (using dumbbells or a medicine ball): 3 sets of 10-15 reps
6. Cool-down: 5-10 minutes of stretching

**Saturday and Sunday (Rest Days)**

* Continue with light cardio and stretching on these days to maintain muscle recovery.

**Progressive Overload:**

To ensure progressive overload, we'll increase the weight or reps by 2.5-5lbs/1-2 kg every two weeks. For example:

* Increase the barbell bench press by 2.5-5lbs/1-2 kg
* Increase the number of sets from 3 to 4

**Rest Periods:**

In strength-focused phases (Phase 3 and 4), we'll increase the rest period to 3-4 minutes.

**Accessory Work:**

We'll include accessory exercises every 4-6 weeks to prevent stagnation. For example:

* In Phase 1, add a Bulgarian Split Squat (BSS) exercise once a week.
* In Phase 2, replace one of Bob's primary exercises with an isolation workday (e.g., Tricep Kickbacks).

**Example Rep-Max Chart:**

To determine the rep-max for each exercise, we can use the following formula:

1RM = W x (1 + 0.0333n)

Where n is the number of reps.

For example, if Bob has a 100kg weight and wants to achieve an 8-rep max on the bench press, his 1RM would be calculated as follows:

1RM = 100 kg x (1 + 0.0333 x 8) â‰ˆ 115 kg

This means Bob needs to lift at least 115kg for 8 reps.

Note that this is a simplified example and actual rep-max calculations may vary depending on individual factors, such as genetics, training experience, and muscle fiber composition."
