    **User Profile:**
    - Name: {user_name}
    - Age: {user_data_row.get("Age", "N/A")}
    - Gender: {user_data_row.get("Gender", "N/A")}
    - Height: {user_data_row.get("Height (cm)", "N/A")} cm
    - Weight: {user_data_row.get("Weight (Kg)", "N/A")} kg
    - Fitness Goal(s): {user_data_row.get("What are your fitness goals? (You can select multiple options)", "N/A")}
    - Fitness Level: {user_data_row.get("How would you rate your fitness level?", "N/A")}
    - Workout Frequency: {user_data_row.get("How many days per week are you planning to working out?", "N/A")} days per week
    - Workout Duration: {user_data_row.get("How much time can you dedicate to each workout session?", "N/A")}
    - Workout Location: {user_data_row.get("Where are you planning to work out?", "N/A")}

    - Cardio Preference: {user_data_row.get("Would you like to include cardio in your fitness program?", "N/A")}
    - Daily Activity Level: {user_data_row.get("What is your daily activity?", "N/A")}
    - Injury/Medical Condition: {user_data_row.get("Do you have any injury or medical condition?", "N/A")}
    - Injury Details (if any): {user_data_row.get("If you answered yes to above question, please provide a short description.", "N/A")}

    ---

    **Your Task:**
    1. Based on the user's profile and the expert-designed guidelines, create a 4-week workout plan tailored to their needs.
    2. Include:
    - Exercise names, sets, reps, intensity (%1RM), and rest times.
    - Weekly progression details (e.g., increasing weight by 5% in Week 2).
    - Adjustments for weak points or health considerations (e.g., knee pain).
    - Optional supersets or circuits if time availability is limited.
    3. Generate the program in the following format:

        Week 1:

        Day 1: Lower Body
        A1: Barbell Back Squat - 4x8 at 65% 1RM (e.g., 50 kg), rest 90s.
        B1: Romanian Deadlift - 3x10 at 50% 1RM (e.g., 40 kg), rest 60s.
        B2: Bulgarian Split Squat - 3x8 per leg, rest 60s.
        C1: Plank Hold - 3x45 seconds.

        Day 2: Upper Body ..

    Ensure the program is logically structured and aligned with the user's fitness goals and preferences.
