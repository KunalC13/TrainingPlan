    **Your Task:**
    1. Based on the user's profile and the expert-designed guidelines, create a 4-week workout plan tailored to their needs.
    2. Include:
    - Exercise names, sets, reps, intensity (%1RM), and rest times.
    - Weekly progression details (e.g., increasing weight by 5% in Week 2).
    - Adjustments for weak points or health considerations (e.g., knee pain).
    - Optional supersets or circuits if time availability is limited.
    3. Generate the program in the following format (Training Plan overview example):
        
        Goal: General strength with hypertrophy focus.
        Frequency: 3 days per week.
