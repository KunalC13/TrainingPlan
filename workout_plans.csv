**Additional Tips and Modifications:**

1. **Knee-Friendly Exercises:** Avoid deep squats, lunges, and deadlifts. Instead, use leg press or step-ups.
2. **Proper Form:** Emphasize proper form over weight and reps. If you feel any discomfort or pain, stop the exercise immediately.
3. **Rest and Recovery:** Ensure 1-2 rest days between workouts, and prioritize sleep (7-9 hours) and nutrition for recovery.
4. **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase weight or reps every two weeks to challenge yourself and promote progress.

**Cardio and Active Recovery:**

1. Incorporate low-intensity steady-state cardio (LISS) 2 times a week, such as walking, cycling, or light jogging.
2. Engage in stair climbing or other low-impact cardio exercises 1-2 times a week to maintain cardiovascular fitness.

**Injury Prevention and Management:**

1. Consult with your doctor or physical therapist before starting any new exercise program.
2. Listen to your body and stop immediately if you experience knee pain or discomfort.
3. Consider incorporating exercises that strengthen the core and glutes, which can help alleviate knee stress.

Remember, consistency and patience are key. Stick to this workout plan and make adjustments as needed. Consult with a healthcare professional or fitness coach for personalized guidance and support."

As Jacek becomes stronger and more comfortable with the workout plan, it's essential to increase the weight or resistance used in each exercise. This can be achieved by:

* Increasing the weight used in strength exercises
* Adding reps or sets to hypertrophy exercises
* Decreasing rest periods between exercises

**Consultation**

Before starting this workout plan, consult with a healthcare professional or certified personal trainer to discuss any concerns, modify exercises as needed, and ensure Jacek is following proper form and technique.

* Jessi should focus on proper form and technique throughout each exercise to ensure safety and effectiveness.
* To accommodate her injury, use a balance board or other assistive device when performing exercises that challenge balance, such as squats with balance board support.
* Incorporate low-impact cardio activities like jogging or cycling for 10-15 minutes after the workout to help alleviate symptoms of endometriosis (e.g., pelvic pain).
* Prioritize rest and recovery days to allow her body to adapt to the demands of the workout plan.

**Note:** Before starting any new exercise program, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional, especially given Jessi's injury and medical condition. This workout plan is designed as a general guideline, and adjustments may be necessary based on individual progress and feedback."

**Additional Tips:**

1. Warm up properly before each workout with 5-10 minutes of light cardio and dynamic stretching.
2. Focus on proper posture and alignment during exercises to maintain efficiency and prevent injury.
3. Increase the weight or reps as your body adapts, but do not sacrifice form for heavier weights or more reps.
4. Include low-intensity steady state (LISS) cardio sessions (30-45 minutes, 2-3 times a week) for improved cardiovascular endurance.

**Progressive Overload:**

1. Aim to increase the weight by 2.5-5 kg/5-10 lbs every two weeks or as soon as you feel you can lift more.
2. Increase the number of reps by 2-3 every two weeks, but do not sacrifice form for heavier weights.

**Nutrition and Recovery:**

1. Ensure a caloric surplus of 250-500 calories above your maintenance level to support muscle growth.
2. Eat protein-rich foods within an hour after each workout to aid in muscle recovery and growth.
3. Get at least 7-9 hours of sleep each night to aid in muscle recovery and growth.

Please consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program."
