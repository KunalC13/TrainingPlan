Program Design, key Points to consider when creating a program


General informations:
Sets (number of rounds of a given exercise)
Reps (number of repetitions per set)
Load (weight lifted)
Intensity is usually expressed as a percentage of your 1RM (the maximum weight you can lift for one repetition).
Low intensity: 60–70% of 1RM
Moderate intensity: 75–85% of 1RM
High intensity: 85–95% of 1RM
Maximal intensity: 95%+ of 1RM
→Intensity= (Load lifted​/1 rm)×100

Organizational Structure
A, B, C, and D labels categorize exercises into sequences or supersets, making workouts easy to follow. Each letter represents a distinct group of exercises or movement patterns to be performed in a specific order.
Training Goals
The A–D sequence ensures that exercises align with the goals of the workout:
Strength or power training might focus heavily on the A and B series.
Hypertrophy (muscle building) programs may incorporate more B and C series to target specific muscle groups.
Functional fitness or conditioning may use the D series for additional work like core or endurance.
→Prioritization
A Series: Exercises labeled "A" are typically the primary or most important movements in the workout. These are often compound lifts like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, or pull-ups, which target multiple muscle groups and require the most energy and focus.
B Series: Exercises in the "B" series are secondary but still important. These may include accessory lifts or compound movements with slightly less load or complexity.
C Series: These exercises focus on smaller muscle groups, isolation work, or skill-specific training. Examples include bicep curls, tricep pushdowns, or mobility drills.
D Series(optional): Often optional or lower-priority movements, these could include additional accessory work, core exercises, or conditioning components.


A-D order is also crucial for fatigue Management
This sequencing manages energy and fatigue:
Early exercises (A, B) utilize higher intensity, heavier weights, or more technical movements when the body is fresh.
Later exercises (C, D) are less demanding, focusing on smaller muscles or conditioning.
Superset and Circuit Structure
Sometimes, the letters also indicate supersets (e.g., A1, A2) or circuits:
A1 and A2 might mean two exercises performed back-to-back with little rest.
B1, B2, etc., indicate a different superset or sequence. 
Example workout with A–D series
A Series: Primary Lift
A1: Barbell Back Squat (4 sets of 6-8 reps)
B Series: Secondary Movements
B1: Romanian Deadlift (3 sets of 8-10 reps)
B2: Bulgarian Split Squat (3 sets of 8-10 reps each leg)
C Series: Accessory Work
C1: Dumbbell Lateral Raises (3 sets of 10-12 reps)
C2: Hammer Curls (3 sets of 10 reps)
D Series: Core/Conditioning
D1: Plank Hold (3 sets of 45 seconds)
D2: Russian Twists (3 sets of 20 reps)
This structure creates a logical flow, balances energy use, and ensures all aspects of training are addressed effectively.





2. Progression Across Phases (more in detail to the phases on point 5)
Volume progressively decreases, while intensity increases:
Phase
Volume (Sets × Reps × Load)
Intensity (%1RM)
Focus
Hypertrophy
High
65–75%
Muscle growth
Strength
Moderate
75–85%
Maximal strength
Power
Low
85–95%
Force production
Peaking
Very low
90–100%
Maximal performance

Determining Volume for Each Phase
Estimate Weekly Volume:
Base weekly volume on training experience:
Beginner: ~10,000–15,000 kg/week.
Intermediate: ~15,000–25,000 kg/week.
Advanced: ~25,000–35,000 kg/week.
Allocate Across Sessions:
-Divide weekly volume into 3–5 sessions based on training frequency.
-Ensure balanced muscle group training.
Adjust by Phase:
Start with higher weekly volume in hypertrophy.
Gradually decrease as intensity increases in later phases.

3. Define the 20% Spread
To calculate a 20% spread across all sets, the total weight difference between the lightest set and the heaviest set (60 kg) is distributed evenly.
Step 1: Total Spread and Number of Steps
Spread Difference: 60 kg×0.2=12 kg  
Spread applies across all sets, starting from the lightest set to the heaviest.
Step 2: Determine Lightest Set Weight
Subtract the total spread (12 kg) from the heaviest set to find the lightest set weight:
Lightest Set Weight=60kg−12kg= 48kg
Final Set Weights
Set 1: 48 kg
Set 2: 48+4=52 kg
Set 3: 52+4=56 kg
Set 4: 56+4=60 kg
The weights would be: 48 kg, 52 kg, 56 kg, 60 kg.
why spread?
Beginner or Intermediate Lifters 20% spread for main lifts 
Effectiveness: For beginners or intermediates, this type of spread can still be effective because it promotes gradual progression and teaches the body to handle increasing loads over time.
Why: Beginners will still be improving their form, and the lower weights make it easier to build a foundation without risking injury. Intermediate lifters might see good results with hypertrophy and general strength gains from this spread, though they may need heavier lifts to continue progressing.
Starting lighter allows you to refine your form and motor patterns before progressing to heavier loads. This is particularly useful for beginners or lifters focusing on technique.
Avoiding Fatigue:By spreading the load, you reduce the risk of early fatigue. This is beneficial when the focus is on maintaining quality across all sets rather than peaking intensity.
Comparison: 15% vs. 20% Spread   (idea for lighter training days)
15% Spread: More consistent intensity, better for strength and hypertrophy training.
20% Spread: Greater variation, which may be better for endurance or lighter training days.
Reminder:
Training Volume = Sets × Reps × Weight
is typically manipulated by adjusting:
Sets (number of rounds of a given exercise)
Reps (number of repetitions per set)
Load (weight lifted)
Intensity is usually expressed as a percentage of your 1RM (the maximum weight you can lift for one repetition).
Low intensity: 60–70% of 1RM
Moderate intensity: 75–85% of 1RM
High intensity: 85–95% of 1RM
Maximal intensity: 95%+ of 1RM
Intensity=   (Load lifted​/1 rm)×100
4. Exercises to target weak points:
Weak Posterior Chain: Romanian Deadlifts or Hip Thrusts
Poor Shoulder Stability: Face Pulls or External Rotations.
Knee Pain: step-ups, reverse lunges and leg extensions.
Back Pain: back extension, generally all back exercises, deadlifts.
Ensure Exercise Variety
While consistency is key, variety prevents overuse injuries and plateaus:
Rotate between similar exercises every 4–8 weeks 
Use unilateral exercises (e.g., Bulgarian Split Squats) to build balance and stability.
Order exercises to maximize performance:
Primary Strength Lifts (e.g., Squats, Deadlifts)
Accessory Work (e.g., Rows, Lunges)
Isolation or Core Work (e.g., Curls, Planks)












5. Linear Periodization (Training style)

Phase 1: Hypertrophy/Endurance Phase (High Volume/ many sets)
Goal: Build muscle mass and improve endurance by working with moderate weights and high volume.
Duration: 4–6 weeks
Rep Range: 8–12 reps (or 12–15 for endurance focus)
Intensity: 60–75% of 1RM
Rest Period: 60–90 seconds

Phase 2: Strength-Endurance/Strength Foundation Phase (moderate volume/ still but lower than phase 1 )
Goal: Build strength endurance and transition to heavier loads.
Duration: 3–4 weeks
Rep Range: 6–8 reps
Intensity: 75–80% of 1RM
Rest Period: 90–120 seconds
Phase 3: Strength Phase (low volume high intensity)
Goal: Increase maximal strength by lifting heavier loads with lower reps.
Duration: 4–6 weeks
Rep Range: 4–6 reps
Intensity: 80–90% of 1RM
Rest Period: 2–3 minutes
How to adjust:
If you were doing 4 sets of 10 reps with 70% of your 1RM in Phase 1, you may switch to 4 sets of 6–8 reps with 80% of your 1RM in Phase 2.

→after each phase evaluate, whether you were able to do all the reps and sets, if yes then continue to the next phase and re-asses the 1 RM to adjust the intensity accordingly.



Rep-Max Chart (Rep-Max Table) → more detail about intensity %

1RM=W×(1+0.0333×R)
A rep-max table or rep-max chart helps estimate your max performance for a given number of repetitions based on the weight lifted. You can use these charts to determine appropriate loads for specific rep ranges.
For example, based on a known 1RM, you can look up the rep max for different reps and weights. Here's a simplified version of a rep-max table.
example:

Key Considerations for a 4-Phase Program:
Progressive Overload:
As intensity increases, the volume (sets and reps) should decrease to allow the body to adapt and grow stronger.
Be mindful of making small, consistent increases in weight or reps to avoid plateaus.
Exercise Variation:
Change accessory exercises every 4–6 weeks to prevent stagnation and address muscle imbalances.
Focus on compound movements during strength-focused phases and add isolation work during hypertrophy/endurance phases.
Rest Periods:
In strength phases (especially in Phase 3 and 4), you need longer rest periods to recover from heavy lifts (2–5 minutes).
In hypertrophy/endurance phases, rest periods can be shorter (60–90 seconds) to increase metabolic stress.
Periodization Goals:
The first phases (1 and 2) build foundational muscle and strength, while later phases (3 and 4) focus on achieving peak performance and maximum strength.
The transition between phases is gradual, so your body can adapt progressively without undue stress.
Exercise Variation:

Strategically changing exercises and loading strategies is critical to avoiding injury, staleness and maximizing long term success. Variation can be created through Loading Strategy, Exercise Selection and Tempo, the proper use of these elements will allow us to satisfy Directed Adaptation without running into Adaptive Resistance.
