# Program Design: Key Points for Creating a Training Program

## General Information
- **Sets**: Number of rounds of a given exercise
- **Reps**: Number of repetitions per set
- **Load**: Weight lifted
- **Intensity**: Usually expressed as a percentage of 1RM (the maximum weight you can lift for one repetition)
  - **Low Intensity**: 60–70% of 1RM
  - **Moderate Intensity**: 75–85% of 1RM
  - **High Intensity**: 85–95% of 1RM
  - **Maximal Intensity**: 95%+ of 1RM
  - **Formula**: `Intensity = (Load Lifted / 1RM) * 100`

## Organizational Structure

### Exercise Categorization (A–D Series)
- **A Series**: Primary or most important movements (e.g., squats, deadlifts, bench presses)
- **B Series**: Secondary but still essential exercises (e.g., accessory lifts)
- **C Series**: Isolation work or skill-specific training (e.g., bicep curls, mobility drills)
- **D Series** (Optional): Additional accessory work, core exercises, or conditioning

### Fatigue Management
- Early exercises (A, B) are higher intensity, heavier, and more technical
- Later exercises (C, D) focus on smaller muscles or conditioning

### Supersets and Circuits
- `A1, A2` → Two exercises performed back-to-back with little rest
- `B1, B2` → Different superset or sequence

### Example Workout Structure
#### **A Series: Primary Lift**
- A1: Barbell Back Squat (4 sets of 6-8 reps)
#### **B Series: Secondary Movements**
- B1: Romanian Deadlift (3 sets of 8-10 reps)
- B2: Bulgarian Split Squat (3 sets of 8-10 reps each leg)
#### **C Series: Accessory Work**
- C1: Dumbbell Lateral Raises (3 sets of 10-12 reps)
- C2: Hammer Curls (3 sets of 10 reps)
#### **D Series: Core/Conditioning**
- D1: Plank Hold (3 sets of 45 seconds)
- D2: Russian Twists (3 sets of 20 reps)

## Progression Across Phases
| Phase       | Volume | Intensity (% 1RM) | Focus              |
|------------|--------|------------------|--------------------|
| Hypertrophy | High   | 65–75%           | Muscle Growth      |
| Strength    | Moderate | 75–85%         | Maximal Strength   |
| Power       | Low    | 85–95%           | Force Production   |
| Peaking     | Very Low | 90–100%        | Maximal Performance |

### Determining Volume per Phase
- **Beginner**: ~10,000–15,000 kg/week
- **Intermediate**: ~15,000–25,000 kg/week
- **Advanced**: ~25,000–35,000 kg/week

### Weekly Training Plan Example
**Goal**: General strength with hypertrophy focus  
**Frequency**: 3 days per week

#### **Week 1 Training Details**
##### **Day 1: Lower Body**
- Back Squat: 4 sets × 6 reps × 100 kg = 2,400 kg
- Romanian Deadlift: 3 sets × 10 reps × 70 kg = 2,100 kg
- Bulgarian Split Squat: 3 sets × 12 reps × 20 kg = 1,440 kg
- Leg Curls: 3 sets × 15 reps × 40 kg = 1,800 kg  
**Total Volume: 7,740 kg**

##### **Day 2: Upper Body**
- Bench Press: 4 sets × 6 reps × 80 kg = 1,920 kg
- Dumbbell Incline Press: 3 sets × 12 reps × 25 kg = 1,800 kg
- Pull-Ups: 4 sets × 10 reps × Bodyweight (75 kg) = 3,000 kg
- Tricep Pushdowns: 3 sets × 15 reps × 30 kg = 1,350 kg  
**Total Volume: 8,070 kg**

##### **Day 3: Full Body**
- Deadlift: 4 sets × 5 reps × 120 kg = 2,400 kg
- Front Squat: 3 sets × 8 reps × 70 kg = 1,680 kg
- Bent-Over Row: 4 sets × 8 reps × 60 kg = 1,920 kg
- Plank Holds: 3 sets × 60 seconds (bodyweight) = Not calculated as load-based  
**Total Volume: 6,000 kg**

**Weekly Volume Summary:**  
Week 1 Total: **21,810 kg**

## Linear Periodization (Training Style)
### **Phase 1: Hypertrophy/Endurance**
- **Goal**: Muscle mass and endurance
- **Duration**: 4–6 weeks
- **Rep Range**: 8–12 reps
- **Intensity**: 60–75% of 1RM
- **Rest**: 60–90 seconds

### **Phase 2: Strength-Endurance**
- **Goal**: Transition to heavier loads
- **Duration**: 3–4 weeks
- **Rep Range**: 6–8 reps
- **Intensity**: 75–80% of 1RM
- **Rest**: 90–120 seconds

### **Phase 3: Strength**
- **Goal**: Increase maximal strength
- **Duration**: 4–6 weeks
- **Rep Range**: 4–6 reps
- **Intensity**: 80–90% of 1RM
- **Rest**: 2–3 minutes

## Rep-Max Chart
| Reps | % of 1RM | Example (1RM = 100 kg) |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| 1    | 100%    | 100 kg                |
| 3    | 93%     | 93 kg                 |
| 5    | 85%     | 85 kg                 |
| 8    | 77%     | 77 kg                 |
| 10   | 70%     | 70 kg                 |
| 12   | 65%     | 65 kg                 |
| 15   | 60%     | 60 kg                 |

## Key Considerations for a 4-Phase Program
- **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase load to avoid plateaus
- **Exercise Variation**: Change accessory exercises every 4–6 weeks
- **Rest Periods**: Strength phases (2–5 minutes), Hypertrophy (60–90 seconds)
- **Periodization Goals**: Gradual transitions ensure steady adaptation

---

## Exercise Variation & Adaptation
- **Primary Strength Lifts**: Squats, Deadlifts
- **Accessory Work**: Rows, Lunges
- **Isolation or Core Work**: Curls, Planks

By structuring your training with **logical sequencing, progression, and phase adaptation**, you can maximize performance and avoid overuse injuries while ensuring consistent improvements.
